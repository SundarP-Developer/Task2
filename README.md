# Task 2

# Student Record Management System

This is a Student Record Management System Task which is used to store student details and manage their records.In the task 
I used ArrayList to store each student details as a object. ArrayList is used for fast access. I used switch case 
to get the input from user, what operation are they going to do. I created a separate class for get student details. In this 
class variables are private which is hard to access them outside the class without proper methods. Also I created a separate 
class for operations like Add student details, View student details, Update student details and Delete student details. I created 
these method static so I can easily access it without creating the object for that class.
